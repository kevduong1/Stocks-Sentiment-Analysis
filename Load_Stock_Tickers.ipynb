      "By Tom Schoenberg,Matt Robinson, andSridhar Natarajan  May 3, 2022, 11:01 PM CDT \n",
      "\n",
      "Bill Hwang’s lawyers couldn’t believe it.\n",
      "The fallen billionaire investor was sitting in federal custody in Manhattan, less than 48 hours after his legal team had visited prosecutors to talk them out of criminal charges. The effort seemed to be going well until the feds scooped up Hwang at daybreak on April 27 to face 11 felony charges and potentially, the rest of his life in prison. In no event was an arrest necessary, his attorneys said in a statement expressing frustration that morning, noting Hwang had been voluntarily answering the government’s questions for months.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of Wall Street should pay close attention. The Hwang case marks an upswing of federal investigations into a slew of suspected trading abuses. Three other broad inquiries have emerged in recent months to examine so-called block trades, short sales, and well-timed wagers. They all center on the same question: Are markets rigged? relates to Wall Street Isn’t Ready for the Crackdown Coming Its Way Hwang faces 11 felony charges. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg\n",
      "\n",
      "Biden administration officials have spent the past year laying groundwork to pursue white-collar crime more aggressively, rolling out policy changes some disclosed, some not that will make probes easier to start, faster to finish, and more punishing. The U.S. Department of Justice has quietly ratcheted up pressure on big banks to look for market abuses and then turn in staff and clients, and there’s growing willingness among prosecutors to use tough federal laws against Wall Streeters that were designed to target gangsters. Meanwhile, there are signs that the Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking larger civil penalties. Senior leaders at the agency have stopped accepting ad nauseam meetings with defense attorneys looking to talk their clients out of trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a perception that there are two sets of rules, says Gurbir Grewal, head of the SEC's enforcement division. We want everyday Americans to have confidence when they invest in the market. They should have confidence knowing that there's a dedicated group of professionals to deal with new threats, traditional frauds, making sure that their retirements are safe.\n",
      "Many Wall Street denizens don’t seem to grasp what’s afoot, even as Hwang’s treatment underscores the shift. For months his legal team made the case that his family office, Archegos Capital Management, acted lawfully as it built massive positions on a small number of stocks, driving their prices to record highs before they crashed. Archegos and the banks that let it trade with borrowed money lost billions of dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, on the very day Hwang’s lawyers thought they were to have a further productive meeting with U.S. investigators, prosecutors filed a sealed indictment against him and Archegos’s chief financial officer, Patrick Halligan,  that included a charge under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO. Authorities alleged that the pair lied to banks and manipulated stock prices. When officers pulled up to their homes without warning two days later, Halligan was already on his train commute into Manhattan. His mobile rang: Agents were outside his front door, looking to arrest him. Halligan grabbed a taxi back to meet them. relates to Wall Street Isn’t Ready for the Crackdown Coming Its Way Halligan departing federal court in New York on April 27.

      "Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco commended Manhattan investigators on the speed of their 13-month investigation unusually fast on Wall Street, where targets often have the best lawyers money can buy. This is exactly the kind of criminal case that the Department of Justice should prioritize, she said at a press conference. Then came a hint:  And we will continue to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind the scenes, the feds have been gathering information on dozens of banks, investment firms, and their executives as part of other sweeping probes. Many elements of these inquiries as well as the tactics the government is using were described by U.S. officials, industry professionals, and lawyers who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to talk publicly.\n",

      "Shop earnings are scheduled AH and they'll tank. Just looking at their previous earnings, they were all pumped up by their stakes in two companies: Global-e , and Affirm, both these companies are publicly traded so it's easy to predict Shopify bottom line, they both lost more than 30% of value in the last 3 months.\n",

      "\n",
      "To break down Shopify business numbers and try to predict their Q1 earnings we'll rely on two factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1- their investments: comfortably predicting that number will be negative\n",
      "\n",
      "2- their core business, coming out of covid high growth, and looking at Netflix subscription numbers, and amazon e-commerce numbers, we can predict that their subscription numbers are down from previous quarter and from previous year. Beside their shops subscriptions they have a category of \"e-commerce\" services that include various services they offers to shops owners including payment Solutions, this segment pulled 1 billion in revenue last quarter, and it it the most promising part of the growth story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shopify doubled their work force in 2021, this bad news, because they will weigh in on their expenses in a period where key growth metrics will be slowing down significantly or even going negativite, in these environment a lot of companies including Meta, Netflix, peloton...etc are slowing down their spending and firing large numbers of employees.\n",

      "Shopify has around half a billion in cash that it said it's using to further devolop their investments and products, but we can assume that none of these investments will translate into revenue or profits in this quarter earnings, as these kinds of investments take many quarters or several years to generate a return.\n",
      "\n",
      "So to sum it up, Shopify has around 10% in Global-e, and 10% in affirm, both went down last quarter, this will translate to more than a billion dollars losses for the company, their net profit from their core business will be in the negative no doubt, with macro-economic shit putting significant pressure on it. The only upside for investors hoping for an upside (or at least avoiding a panic selling) is that Shopify is 70% owned by institutions that can wait it out and not panic sell, and for them (and even retail) to not pay attentions to significant unrealized losses on their investments and focusing only on the griowth story of their core business.\n",

      "# Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the beginning of the year, several events have transpired that have shaped the Uranium space. These are some of the main ones, as well as a telling clue as to why I believe this is going to be the trade to be in for the next 12-24 months. I will begin with the CCJ earnings call, as their next earnings call is on Thursday 5/5/2022…or more affectionately known as - Cameco de Mayo\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **CCJ earnings call** \\- Taken place on Feb 9th, we learned that Cameco had begun long-term contracts. Tim Gitzel (CEO), who is relatively mild-mannered and conservative during these calls, was noticeably much more bullish in tone than normal. He explained that they had termed out 30 million lbs of uranium in 2021, as well as improving fundamentals. Further explaining, that in January ALONE, they had added 40million lbs of long-term contracts…likely attributable to the unrest in Kazakhstan in January. They also announced that they would be restarting McArthur River and Key Lake Mill. Restarting these would only be done under one scenario…the bear market is over and the bull market had begun. This marked the turnaround of the Uranium stocks, which had since been in a large pullback. For those who do not know, this space is notorious for vicious pullbacks and ripping rallies…the latter is why I am writing this today. Take a quick look at all the stocks in the Uranium space for the days/weeks following that call…I would look closer at the ones that are the most easily investable and liquid, should Jim Cramer declare world peace and state a melt-up is coming…seriously, how that guy is actually allowed to talk and give financial advice is insane. Part of me thinks he takes his advice from David Hunter. Again, I digress…moving on.\n",

      "1. **Kazakhstan** \\- Around the beginning of January, civil unrest began to take place in Kazakhstan. This is of particular interest to Uranium investors, as a majority of the world’s uranium is mined there…approximately \\~40% (link below). This, along with other supply/demand fundamentals (will be brought up later), is likely why Cameco had such an insane earnings call, as well as many stocks doubling and nearly tripling since then. The unrest here is notable because the magnitude of how much this country contributes total uranium supply worldwide. It would be akin to OPEC oil supply being in question (\\~40%...link below). In fact, Russia had to come in and save the day from all the turmoil (more on that later). Now, if you were a utility company (who actually uses the uranium) and you have a risk management or fuel buying team, you probably are going to want to make sure you do not run into any supply disruptions that could screw you over. I would likely look to de-risk the scenario by diversifying why I obtained future uranium supply, signing long term contracts (You can count on one hand the actual amount of uranium producers out there…reminder, we are coming out of a BEAR market), and likely keeping a close eye on the situation moving forward.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Ukraine and Russia** \\- Right after unrest in Kazakhstan, the Ukraine/Russia war began. Amongst many other commodities, this is of particular importance to the uranium space because of both Russia’s proximity to Kazakhstan (risk management and CSTO potentially dragging Kazakhstan into the conflict - a bit of a rabbit hole there…stick to the next bit) and Russia’s role in the world’s uranium enrichment process - accounting for nearly 40% of it. This is essentially the end product of uranium that nuclear reactors use (link and source of commentary from president of a nuclear fuel market analysis firm are below…only a few pages). Since this end product is exactly what nuclear reactors use, a disruption at this point of the fuel cycle can cause MASSIVE upstream effects… which is referred to as overfeeding. Rather than try to explain it here, there is a short video (20 minutes) that I will link below. It also includes Mark Nelson, a strong, well-spoken advocate for nuclear energy. He was also EXTREMELY active on Twitter during the Chernobyl FUD fiasco that took place when there was fighting around that reactor. MSM pumped up there could be another meltdown or nuclear accident…all for theatrical purposes IMO and it is a bunch of BS. New reactors are built to withstand more than bullets…in fact jets (link below)...I digress.\n",

If the energy crisis is already fully underway (irrespective of who is at fault), it would be easy to score political brownie points by being anti-Russia with anything.\n",

Most nuclear reactors, typically store a few years' supply out in advance. Those current supplies are now dwindling and restocking is going to be needed.

      "\n",
      "Daddy Pow Pow hopes that by giving a .5bp increase that it will slow down consumer demand by slightly increasing prices of consumer goods. For many who have surplus income this will have little to no impact on how they live, for others this may cause them to decrease the quality of product that they buy or simply to buy less. For most, this will negatively impact household savings. \n",
      "\n",
      "In doing this, Daddy Pow Pow admits that he has no significant ability to impact supply chain issues. Most of the problems we are seeing with prices of consumer goods relate to supply chain issues so aside from potential decreasing supply chain demand, there will be little to no impact on that front. Supply chain issues will still fuck us. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Daddy Pow Pow hopes that this increase in prices will get persons who are currently not working to go back to work. These persons include: retired persons, teenagers, college students, persons collecting unemployment, persons living on government stipends / welfare, etc. If nothing else changed over the next 12 months except for what Daddy Pow Pow did, then this may likely cause more persons to work and thus increase our economic stability / growth. However, what Daddy Pow Pow didn't account for in this plan are the things that will happen which he knows he can't prevent. \n",

      "**There are so many things that Daddy Pow Pow didn't consider that I will list some out here:** \n",
      "\n",
      "* When costs go up, students can borrow more money for college. Universities will forecast expected costs of college and students will be able to borrow up to that amount. This may actually lead to less college students working part time jobs as it becomes easier for them to get more money and then spend it on booze, beans, and rice. \n",
      "* Legislators are already finding solutions to keep their indentured voters indentured to vote for their party and these solutions will completely debunk what Daddy Pow Pow is attempting to do. For example, if we were to see UBI even at a level of $200 / month it would completely override any changes Daddy Pow Pow was hoping to create. Just think of all the ways our government buys their voters by keeping people from being productive citizens - any legislation pushing such ideologies will negate the intended effect of what Daddy Pow Pow is trying to achieve. \n",
      "* Supply Chain Issues may be heightened with decreased demand. If I'm a vendor who ships dog food and it costs me $100 to ship the dog food regardless of if it's 20 bags or 50 bags then I would ideally want to ship in batches close to 50 bags. High demand supports cost savings for the supply chain. What happens though when my price per unit to ship goes up because my batch size decreases? Well someone has to swallow those costs which means I lose some money and I also pass some losses onto my consumers in the form of a higher price. Now businesses are slowing down and prices go up even more. we might suggest that this could be like pseudo inflation. \n",
      "* We're just barely starting to watch this whole war shit show. a .5bp rate hike with possibility of war suggests that Daddy Pow Pow thinks the whole war shindig is a complete joke and that there is no reason to address the inflation in an urgent manner. We can address it slowly over 2 - 4 years with his plan however if we see increase in war then his plan goes flying out the window. Basically Daddy is saying war is a joke and all the virtue signaling retards are exactly that: regards. What if though, we do see more war? What if China does indeed invade Taiwan? Weelll shiiiiit. We fucked good because at that point our efforts to address inflation wouldn't have been aggressive enough. \n",
      "* Daddy Pow Pow chose to implement a slow plan that takes several years but Daddy Pow Pow has no clue what the future holds. Do we? IDK maybe one of you apes does but I sure as frickles don't. That being said, I believe it would have been a stronger more effective move to go ahead and push out a .75bp or 1.0 bp rate hike as that would force more change now which would leave us in a better position the next time shit hits the fan.
